# Why Teisu?

I wanted to make a reactive library just for fun and to gain experience. 

Not only that, but I wanted to take two libraries that I enjoyed using:

- [Vide](https://centau.github.io/vide/)

- [Charm](https://github.com/littensy/charm)

...and combine them into one. I added some changes and quality of life improvements.
